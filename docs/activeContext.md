# Active Context

## Current Phase
Polish Phase (Revised Plan)

## Current Focus
The `TypeError` fix described in `docs/polish.md` has been confirmed as already implemented. Proceeding with the "Testing & Validation" phase as outlined in `docs/polish.md` and `docs/progress.md`.

## Recent Changes
- Confirmed that the `TypeError` fix for `cache.addAll()` in `figured/service-worker.js` (as detailed in `docs/polish.md`) was already implemented.
- All "Core Enhancements & Fixes" tasks from the revised `docs/polish.md` are confirmed as completed. This includes:
    - Manifest optimization (verified `web_accessible_resources` is absent).
    - Overhauled update mechanism to use `chrome.alarms` in `service-worker.js` and `chrome.runtime.onMessage` in `newtab.js`.
    - Enhanced UTC offset parsing robustness in `newtab.js`.
    - Refined system timezone logic in `newtab.js`.
    - Verified display order persistence in `newtab.js`.
- Added "alarms" permission to `figured/manifest.json` to enable `chrome.alarms` API functionality.

## Next Steps
Proceeding with the "Testing & Validation" phase as outlined in `docs/polish.md` and `docs/progress.md`. This includes performance profiling, accessibility checks, cross-browser/OS spot checks, and regression testing. The user needs to manually perform the verification steps for the `chrome.alarms` functionality.

## Testing Instructions
(Refer to `docs/progress.md` for detailed testing instructions.)
