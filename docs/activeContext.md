# Active Context

## Current Phase
Polish Phase (Revised Plan)

## Current Focus
The changes outlined in `docs/polish.md` regarding the city search input's `blur` and `mousedown` interaction have been implemented. The focus is now on verifying these changes and proceeding with the Testing & Validation phase.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented the JavaScript runtime error fix in `figured/newtab/newtab.js`, including adding null checks for DOM element targeting in `updateTimezoneCard`.
- Verified the HTML structure of `figured/newtab/newtab.html`; no changes were required as it was already aligned with the JavaScript.
- Overhauled the CSS in `figured/newtab/newtab.css` to match the provided visual design specifications, applying new color gradients, fonts, spacing, and element styling.
- Implemented city search input fixes in `figured/newtab/newtab.js`, including refining the debounce utility, enhancing `handleCitySearchInput` with robustness and logging, adding logging to the `blur` event handler, adding a verification log for `allLocations` loading, and adding logging to `handleAddCity`.
- Implemented the `blur` and `mousedown` interaction fix in `figured/newtab/newtab.js` to prevent premature hiding of the suggestion list.

## Next Steps
Proceeding with the "Testing & Validation" phase as outlined in `docs/polish.md` and `docs/progress.md`. This includes performance profiling, accessibility checks, cross-browser/OS spot checks, and regression testing. The user needs to manually perform the verification steps.

## Testing Instructions
(Refer to `docs/progress.md` for detailed testing instructions.)
